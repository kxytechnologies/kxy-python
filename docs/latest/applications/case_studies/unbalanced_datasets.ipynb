    "When it is not possible to change the loss function to account for class imbalance, subsampling the most frequent class prior to training is an appealing alternative.

    "## I. The Problem: Unbalanced Classification Problems Yield Too Many False-Negatives\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a heavily unbalanced binary classification problem (i.e. one where positive outcomes are far rarer than negative ones). Examples include fraud detection, claim prediction, network attack detection, telemarketing campaign conversion, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume we are given $n$ i.i.d. observations $(y_i, x_i)$, of which only $m \\ll n$ are of class $1$, the other $n-m$ being of class $0$. For ease of notation, let us assume the first $m$ inputs are of class $1$, so that the log-likelihood reads $$\\mathcal{LL}(\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\log q_\\theta(1, x_i) + \\sum_{i=m+1}^n \\log q_\\theta(0, x_i),$$ where the function $q_\\theta: (y, x) \\to q_\\theta(y, x)$, which satisfies $q_\\theta(1, x) + q_\\theta(0, x) = 1$ for any $x$ and $\\theta$, represents the probability that input $x$ is associated to class $y$ under the model corresponding to parameters $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because $m \\ll n$, the term $\\sum_{i=1}^m \\log q_\\theta(1, x_i)$, which is the contribution of positive outcomes to the overall log-likelihood $\\mathcal{LL}(\\theta)$, will tend to be negligible. Thus, maximizing $\\mathcal{LL}(\\theta)$ will likely result in a model with *a lot of false-negatives* (i.e. a model that predicts all explanatory variables correspond to class $0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very problematic because, in heavily unbalanced problems, accurately predicting the occurence of the least frequent class is usually where the value lies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## II. A Popular Workaround: Subsampling Negative Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple workaround to this problem is to downsample the $n-m$ negative explanatory variables into a subset $(\\tilde{x}_{m+1}, \\dots, \\tilde{x}_{m+k}) \\subset (x_{m+1}, \\dots, x_{n})$ of size $k$ that is close enough to $m$, and to maximize the new log-likelihood $$\\mathcal{LL}_d(\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\log q_\\theta(1, x_i) + \\sum_{i=m+1}^{m+k} \\log q_\\theta(0, \\tilde{x}_i).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark:** When $m$ is large enough, subsampling negative samples is equivalent to the alternative approach consisting of keeping all observations, and maximizing the weighted likelihood $$\\mathcal{LL}_\\omega(\\theta) = (1-\\omega) \\sum_{i=1}^m \\log q_\\theta(1, x_i) + \\omega \\sum_{i=m+1}^{n} \\log q_\\theta(0, x_i), ~~~~ \\text{with} ~~ \\omega = \\frac{k}{n-m+k}.$$\n",
    "However, subsampling has two advantages over reweighting the likelihood or loss function. First, because the subsampled likelihood utilizes fewer observations, subsampling will results in faster (and cheaper) model training than reweighting the likelihood. Second, subsampling does not require changing the loss function, which many toolkits might not allow the machine learning engineer to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## III. The Limits of Subsampling: Distribution Bias & Excessive False-Positives\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, given that $k \\approx m \\ll n-m$, if not done carefully, the subsampling scheme risks introducing a bias in the distribution of explanatory variables corresponding to negative outcomes (i.e. our sampled subset $(\\tilde{x}_{m+1}, \\dots, \\tilde{x}_{m+k})$ might not fully reflect the true conditional distribution $P_{x|y=0}$). \n",
    "Whenever the subsampling scheme is biased, a model trained by maximizing $\\mathcal{LL}_d(\\theta)$ would not know of certain parts of the distribution $P_{x|y=0}$ of negative explanatory variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can negatively affect model performance in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Scenario A: Introduction of new (spurious) patterns**\n",
    "A biased subsampling scheme can (unduly) exacerbate the difference between values of explanatory variables corresponding to $y=0$ and values corresponding to $y=1$, to the point of creating spurious patterns that a classifier might learn to rely on to tell one class apart from the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an illustration, consider an explanatory variable $x$ that is uniformly distributed on $[0, 1]$ both when $y=0$ and when $y=1$. Let us also assume that the class-0 subsampler only selects values in $[\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although $x$ is intrinsically *uninformative* about $y$, after subsampling class-0 observations, it no longer will be, at least not as per the sampled training set. This is because in the sampled training set, from the value of $x$ we can tell whether $y=1$ or $y=0$ more accurately than chance. Indeed, a value of $x$ outside of $[\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}]$ would be a strong indication that $y=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between whether  $x$ is in $[\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}]$ and $y$ in the sampled training set, which is an artifact of the sampler, is a spurious pattern that a classifier can easily rely on to boost training performance, but that will not prevail out-of-sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Scenario B: Destruction of existing (valid) patterns**\n",
    "It may happen that, in the part of the inputs space from which the biased subsampling scheme (mostly) samples, there is no relationship between the inputs/explanatory variables and the target, but in the rest of the inputs space the relationship is much stronger. Whenever this happens, the bias would effectively be destroying valid patterns relating inputs/explanatory variables to the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an illustration, consider an input $x$ that is uniformly distributed on $[\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}]$ when $y=1$ but uniformly distributed on $[0, 1]$ when $y=0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, $x$ is useful to predict $y$, as a value of $x$ outside of $[\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}]$ is a strong indication that $y=0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now assume that the class-0 subsampler only samples values in $[\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}]$. Because $x$ is now uniformly distributed on $[\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}]$ whether $y=0$ or $y=1$, we can no longer tell the two classes apart using $x$ (i.e. $x$ has become uninformative about $y$). \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, no classifier trained using the biased training set will be able to find any reliable pattern relating $x$ to $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, a bias subsampler will always either create new spurious patterns in the data, destroy valuable patterns, or do both. Whatever the case may be, this will ultimately result in any model trained using the biased subsampled training set performing much poorer in production than expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "In production, whenever a set of explanatory variables will come from the unseen part of the distribution $P_{x|y=0}$, a model trained using the biased (but balanced) subsampled training set will have a 50/50 chance of predicting that the associated class is $1$, even though class-1 observations are far less frequent than class-0 observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will typically manifest itself in an excessive number of false-positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## IV. The Solution: Quantifying and Avoiding Subsampling Bias With KXY\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid these excessive false-positives, we need to be able to quantify how much bias an iteration of a sampler induces. This is where the `kxy` package comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $s_i, m < i \\leq n$ be the indicator variable taking value $1$ if and only if the i-th sample $x_i$ is selected by the subsampling scheme, and $0$ otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, the subsampling scheme used induced a bias in the empirical distribution of class-0 explanatory variables if and only if we may find a binary classifier that can predict $s_i$ solely from knowing $x_i$ better than chance (i.e. with an accuracy higher than $\\max \\left(1-\\frac{k}{n-m}, \\frac{k}{n-m} \\right)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the `kxy` package to compute the highest performance achievable when using $x_i$ to predict $s_i$ for $i>m$, we may quantify the amount of bias the subsampler induced. \n",
    "\n",
    "A subsampler generates a bias-free partition of our empirical distribution of class-0 explanatory variables when the highest classification accuracy achievable is as close to $\\max \\left(1-\\frac{k}{n-m}, \\frac{k}{n-m} \\right)$ as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "The higher the achievable accuracy, the higher the bias introduced. As previously discussed, any bias introduced by a subsampler is likely to have adverse consequences, so it is important to always quantify the bias before training a model with a subsampled training set.\n"
